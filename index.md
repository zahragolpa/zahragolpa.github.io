# Welcome!

Hi! 
My name is Zahra Golpayegani, and I am an AI researcher at Huawei Technologies, Canada. I specialize in optimizing large language models (LLMs) for Huawei Ascend NPU chips, enhancing performance during both training and inference. My work includes studying state-of-the-art LLMs, profiling them to identify bottlenecks, designing and implementing novel architectures tailored to Huawei hardware, leveraging modern frameworks to train and evaluate models, and exploring parallelization strategies to maximize efficiency for each model.

Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at Zetane Systems Inc., contributing to two key products: Protector, which evaluates the robustness of commercial computer vision models against adversarial attacks and real-world transformations, and ZetaForge, a visual AI pipeline builder that enables users to create and customize complex AI workflows through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Amirkabir University of Technology and a Master’s in Systems Engineering from Concordia University. During my Master’s, I received a Mitacs Accelerate Explore award to work on testing, validation, and QA of computer vision models and datasets in partnership with Zetane. This experience marked the beginning of my journey at Zetane, initially as a part-time researcher and later as a full-time Machine Learning Engineer.
