# Welcome!

Hi! 
My name is Zahra Golpayegani, and I am an AI researcher.  

Currently, at Huawei, I am focusing on optimizing large language models (LLMs) for Huawei Ascend NPU chips, enhancing performance during both training and inference. My work includes studying state-of-the-art LLMs, profiling them to identify bottlenecks, designing and implementing novel architectures to enhance performance, leveraging modern frameworks to train and evaluate models, and exploring parallelization strategies to optimize each model’s execution. Recently, I have been working with reinforcement learning frameworks, such as VeRL, to train multi-turn agentic pipelines for long-horizon tasks. For more details, check out my <a href="/resume">CV</a>.

Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at Zetane Systems Inc., contributing to two key products: Protector, which evaluates the robustness of commercial computer vision models against adversarial attacks and real-world transformations, and <a href="https://get.zetaforge.com/">ZetaForge</a>, a visual AI pipeline builder that enables users to create and customize complex AI workflows through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Amirkabir University of Technology and a Master’s in Systems Engineering from Concordia University. During my Master’s, I received a Mitacs Accelerate Explore award to work on testing, validation, and QA of computer vision models and datasets in partnership with Zetane. This experience marked the beginning of my journey at Zetane, initially as a part-time Researcher and later as a full-time Machine Learning Engineer.
